# The 12th ICAPS Summer School

The Summer School on Automated Planning and Scheduling in 2024 will be the first in-person summer school since 2018 – *after six long years!*


### When and Where?

The summer school will take place from *27 May 2024* to *31 May 2024* (5 full days), in Banff, the week before ICAPS. So if you plan to attend ICAPS, you could simply arrive one week earlier!


### What?

The summer school provides a comprehensive and incremental overview of frameworks for planning and sequential decision-making (classical planning, stochastic planning, partial observability, RL, etc.) while using integrated task and motion planning (TMP) as the underlying ‘running example’ in the hands-on lab sessions, which are designed to demonstrate ideas and theories discussed in the lectures (designed and executed by Sarah Keren).

The program will include two lectures presented by researchers from the ICAPS community in the morning and early afternoon, followed by the lab session. 


***We will also help hosting ICKEPS 2024:***  
The International Competition on Knowledge Engineering for Planning and Scheduling (ICKEPS) has been running since 2005 as an event promoting the development and importance of the use of knowledge engineering methods and techniques within P&S.  
This year's special edition will be the first one to be run as part of a Summer School, and will focus on the knowledge engineering of domain models showing high degrees of maintainability, extendability, and operationality. Competitors (competing teams) will be provided with the specifications of challenging P&S scenarios and problems, and they will have to produce knowledge models encoding the requirements, and to demonstrate how their KE process will support changes in requirements resulting in extensions and/or modification of the models. The competitors will also have to show how the designed models allow SoA planning engines to generate solutions.

ICKEPS is organized by [Mauro Vallati](https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/persons/mauro-vallati), University of Huddersfield (he will be at the venue); [Lukas Chrpa](http://ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/~chrpa/), Czech Technical University in Prague; and [Ron Petrick](https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/ron-petrick), Heriot Watt University.


The following is a preliminary list of speakers (ordered alphabetically) and topics, possibly incomplete and subject to change:
- [Pascal Bercher](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/pascal-bercher/), Australian National University,  
  gives a talk on *Hierarchical Task Network Planning: Algorithms & Theoretical Foundations*
- [Jeremy Frank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-frank-62141bb3), NASA,  
  gives a talk on *The Distributed Spacecraft Autonomy (DSA) Project*
<!--
Here is an abstract about the project from one of our previous papers:

Autonomous decision-making significantly increases mission effectiveness by mitigating the effects of communication constraints, like latency and bandwidth, and mission complexity on multi-spacecraft operations. To advance the state of the art in autonomous Distributed Space Systems (DSS), the Distributed Spacecraft Autonomy (DSA) team at NASA’s Ames Research Center is developing within five relevant technical areas: distributed resource and task management, reactive operations, system modeling and simulation, human- swarm interaction, and ad hoc network communications. DSA is maturing these technologies - critical for future large autonomous DSS - from concept to launch via simulation studies and orbital deployments. A 100-node heterogenous Processor-in-the-Loop (PiL) testbed aids distributed autonomy capability development and verification of multi-spacecraft missions. The DSA software payload deployed to the D-Orbit SCV-004 spacecraft demonstrates multi-agent reconfigurability and reliability as part of an ESA-sponsored in-orbit technology demonstration. Finally, DSA’s primary flight mission showcases collaborative resource allocation for multipoint science data collection with four small spacecraft as a payload on NASA’s Starling 1.0 satellites.

### Who can join? 

As of now, we have 40 (in-person) spots for participants. We still hope that we can accommodate a higher number of participants, but it currently does not look like it. We understand that not everybody interested can secure a spot, and we apologize for this. The summer school is primarily intended for PhD students, but in principle post-docs are also eligible. If we have more applicants than spots (which at the moment seems to be the case) precedence will be given to PhD students.



### Costs and Sponsorships

It is still too early to provide concrete numbers as we are still in the process of acquiring sponsors. We try to keep the registration fee (which will include accommodation, breakfast, coffee breaks, lunch, and one dinner) as low as possible, and will also offer free registration to very low number of selected participants. In all cases, flights (or any other travel fees) are *not* included and will have to be covered by the attendee.



### Board and Lodging

The costs of the summer school (or a full scholarship, should you receive one) include:
- Six Nights (from Sunday, 26 May to Friday, 31 May). So if you stay for ICAPS, you will have to book the remaining nights yourself.
- Breakfast and Lunch on Monday to Friday
- Dinner on Thursday, 30th



### Important Dates & Application

- Application website opens:   tba
- Application website closes:  tba
- Notifications sent:          tba
- Summer school:               Monday, 27 May to Friday, 31 May 2024.

The application link will be provided here soon.

**Benefits explained:**

- All Silver benefits are included in the Gold benefits, all Gold benefits are included in the Platinum benefits (or slightly improved according to the table).
- poster: You may send us 2 or 1 (Platinum vs Gold) poster up to size A0 directly to the venue. We will prominently display them during all 5 days of the summer school.
- presentation: You may give a 30 or 15 minute (Platinum vs Gold) *online* presentation that our participants will attend (e.g. a pitch on the sponsor's activities). This time does include a Q&A exchange with our participants.
- flyer and goodies: You may send us an A5 PDF, two-sided, which we will print out and distribute to the participants. You may also send us (directly to the venue) some merchandise (pens, etc.) that we will distribute as well. (Consider that everybody will be traveling by plane, so space is restricted.)
- email-forward: You may send us a single email (e.g., in style of a newsletter, announcement, etc.) which we will forward to our participants. (This way you can reach our participants even if they do not consent to make their contact details available.)
- networking package: We will create a LinkedIn group and ask our participants to join (although this is voluntary). Our sponsors will join it too and can hence write an announcement or connect directly with our participants. We furthermore ask our participants for consent to make their contact data available to our sponsors (again this is voluntary). This data will contain their name, status (Master Student, PhD student, Post-Doc etc.), and email address.
- logo: We will make your logo available in large, medium, or small size according to the sponsorship model. This logo will also contain a link to the sponsoring organization. These will be made available both on this (summer school) webpage, as well as on a dedicated summer school page in the ICAPS proceedings (not where the ICAPS sponsors are listed). In case we create some booklet of this summer school (which is not clear yet; but if we do, it will only be a PDF but not printed/formally published), sponsors will be added there as well.
- additional requests: In the Platinum model, you may contact us organizers for any specific proposals (e.g., if you want to send a PhD student to participate), and we can see what we can do.
