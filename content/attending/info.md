# General Information

We'll be updating this page with further information as we get closer to the conference.

## Location

ICAPS 2024 is being held at the Banff Centre in the town of Banff, Alberta within Banff National Park. The Banff Centre has accommodations, sports facilities, access to several hiking trails, and the Vista dining room. It is also a centre for creative arts and often holds art exhibits and performances.

[The Banff Centre](https://www.banffcentre.ca/conferences/destination) has a great deal of information online as well as a [FAQ](https://www.banffcentre.ca/frequently-asked-questions-about-banff-centre). What follows augments and highlights information on the Banff Centre web page.

## Travel

The closest international airport is Calgary International Airport (YYC) in Calgary, Alberta Canada.

## Transportation to the Banff Centre

There are various options for making the approx. 1.5 hour trip from the airport to the Banff Centre:

- Airport shuttle
- Car rental

(Further information will follow)

## Park Fee

The park requires payment of a park fee. (More on this soon.) Click [[here](http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/tarifs-fees/tarif-fee_E.asp?Park=1)] for Daily Park Admission Prices.

## Accommodations

Banff is a tourist town and accommodations fill up quickly. We encourage conference attendees to make your accommodation arrangements as soon as possible to avoid disappointment or high prices.

We have reserved a limited number of accommodations at the Banff Centre, the location of the conference.  You can access these accommodations when you register for the conference.

In addition to accommodations at the Banff Centre, there are accommodations of varying sorts and prices both in the town of Banff and in the adjacent town of Canmore, which is just outside Banff National Park. If you stay in Canmore, you may need to drive to the Banff Centre.

## Getting Around Town

The Banff Centre is a brief 10 minute walk downhill to town. The return trip is slightly longer as it is uphill. Downtown Banff can be reached by taxi for less than $10 each way. There is no shuttle bus that runs from Banff Centre to downtown Banff. There is also no Lyft/Uber in town and apparently only one taxi company.

## Weather

The weather in Banff at the end of May/beginning of June can range from beautiful sunny and warm to snowy. It's shoulder season. Skiing is over and hiking has started, but in a regular season higher elevations will still be snowy and possibly inaccessible.  We'll post weather forecasts closer to the date, but further information is available on the web.

## Banff visitor information

The [Banff Lake Louise Tourism website](http://www.banfflakelouise.com/) makes it easy to plan your visit. [Travel Alberta](http://travelalberta.com/) provides visitor information for the Alberta Rockies as well as destinations throughout the province.
