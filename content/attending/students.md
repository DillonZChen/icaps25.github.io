# Student Support

ICAPS secured funding from NSF and AI Journal to support students’ participation at the conference. The NSF funding is targeted to students from US-based institutes only; the AIJ funding is for students from other institutes. The funding will be distributed to selected students as (partial) **reimbursement of travel and registration expenses** after the conference or as **discounted registration fee**. The exact amount depends on the amount collected from sponsors, your home location, and the number of other applicants. Preference is given to students actively participating at ICAPS (online attendance is not eligible for funding).

Please apply for student support by submitting a request through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps23) (Track: **Student Travel grants**) submitting the following information:
* a short description of your active contribution to ICAPS (e.g., paper presentation, DC, etc.);
* a proposed budget and why support is needed;
* a recommendation letter (in PDF) signed by your supervisor/advisor;
* in fields Title and Keywords, please write “N/A” (EasyChair requires these fields in every submission).

**The deadline for applying is May 1, 2023 (AoE)**. 

Notification is on May 4 (one day before the early registration deadline). Scholarships will be provided to you as (partial) **reimbursement of travel and registration expenses** after the conference or as a **discounted registration fee**.
