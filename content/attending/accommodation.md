# Accommodation

Please book your accommodation as soon as possible! Banff is a popular tourist destination and affordable accommodation will become harder to find the longer you leave it.

There are a limited number of rooms available at the Banff Centre. There are many hotels in Banff, including hostels. Many places offer shared accommodation for more than two people.

The town of Canmore is a short distance from Banff. There is a regular bus service that shuttles people between the two towns. Since Canmore is outside the boundary of Banff National Park, you may find that accommodation can be found at a lower price.
