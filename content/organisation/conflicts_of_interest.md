# Conflicts of Interest

ICAPS 2025 follows closely the definition of "Conflict of Interest" first proposed by NeurIPS 2021. Please read
this document carefully.

Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create or update their OpenReview profile.

You will be asked to declare two types of conflicts---domain conflicts and personal conflicts.  Both types are declared 
by filling out appropriate sections of your OpenReview profile, as described below.

## Domain conflicts (entered in Education & Career History)

Please ensure that this section accurately represents your domain conflicts for (at least) the last three years. For 
current or recent collaborations, including internships, you should generally use personal conflicts (recorded in the 
Advisors & Other Relations section).  Please use domain conflicts judiciously, reserving them for cases when you have 
a genuine conflict of interest with the institution.  Your Education & Career History is public on your OpenReview 
profile.

When you enter a domain conflict, none of your submissions will be visible to reviewers, area chairs, or senior area 
chairs who have also entered this domain conflict.  Only the last three years of your and their Education & Career 
History will be used.

## Conflicts with individual authors and program committee members (entered in Advisors & Other Relations)

The following constitutes a personal conflict:

 - Family or close personal relationship
 - Ph.D. advisee/advisor relationship
 - Current, frequent, or recent collaboration (where recent means within the past three years) 

Please note that OpenReview profiles are persistent across conferences, but other conferences may have a different 
conflict resolution policy.  Any attempt to impact reviewer assignment via false declaration of conflicts may result in
desk rejection.

In case questions arise about special circumstances or cases not discussed above, please contact the ICAPS 2025
