# ICAPS 2024 Doctoral Consortium

The Doctoral Consortium (DC) will provide Ph.D. students with the opportunity to interact closely with established researchers. The consortium has the following objectives: (1) to provide a setting for students to get feedback on their current research and guidance on future research directions; (2) to develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research, improving the cohesion of new researchers with the ICAPS community; (3) to support a new generation of diverse researchers by offering advice about academic, research, industry, and nontraditional career paths; and (4) to contribute to the overall conference goals, through interactions with other researchers and through participation in conference events. 

The DC is open to all doctoral student attendees of the conference and will take place on **June 1st**. Registering for the Doctoral Consortium will be part of the registration process for the conference and all students are invited to take part in it. 

As part of the Doctoral Consortium, ICAPS will offer a Mentoring Program. We encourage current doctoral students (students whose Ph.D. is in progress) to apply for the Mentoring Program. We strongly encourage applications from students with diverse backgrounds to increase the diversity of thought and perspective within the ICAPS community.



## Mentoring Program

The Mentoring Program is designed to provide graduate students with an opportunity for in-depth advice by senior members of the field regarding careers and research skills. Ideal candidates will be mid-way through their program, meaning they have a clear topic and research approach, with some concrete progress but also sufficient time remaining in their program to consider integrating suggestions and new ideas. Each student accepted to the program will be matched with an established researcher in the field who will assist the student with research and career management advice. Students do not need to be accepted into the Mentoring Program to attend and participate in the Doctoral Consortium.

  <h3>Looking for Serendipity – Where (Some) Research Questions Come From?</h3>
  <p>Serendipity is an unplanned fortunate discovery. In this talk, I will describe how I have stumbled on some very interesting research questions by paying attention to small details. I will then try to give some general advice on how to look for interesting research questions in your own work.</p>
