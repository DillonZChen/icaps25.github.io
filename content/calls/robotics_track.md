# ICAPS 2023 Call for Papers: Robotics Track
The Robotics track welcomes research contributions in the general areas of planning and scheduling (P&S), which relate to the advancement of intelligent robots. P&S models and techniques are important for enabling autonomous, flexible, and interactive behaviors in robotic systems. A deep integration of these methods into robotic architectures can assist their effective deployment. In this direction, the ICAPS-2023 Robotics track provides an opportunity for the planning and robotics communities to share research progress in the area of robot planning and showcase the use of planning and scheduling technology in robotics applications. Papers submitted to the robotics track will be reviewed by a special program committee that is constituted of experts in planning for intelligent robots to ensure relevancy while meeting the same high standards of the conference.

Submission of papers that have been demonstrated on actual robotic systems or those that focus on impacting real-world application domains (e.g., logistics, transportation, manufacturing, etc.) are specifically encouraged. Given the tremendous impact of the pandemic, we realize that physical robotic experiments may be challenging. Hence, experiments with simulation platforms are welcome.

Topics include, but are not limited to:
- manipulation task and/or motion planning
- integrated task and motion planning
- learning methods for robot planning
- planning with uncertainty in robotics
- adversarial planning for robots
- representation and acquisition of planning models
- planning for perception
- goal recognition and reasoning
- cognitive robotics
- task teaching and learning by demonstration
- interaction and communication planning
- plan execution, failure detection and recovery
- multi-robot planning, scheduling/coordination, and execution
- formal methods for robot planning and control
- real-world robotic planning applications
- safety, ethics, and transparency in robot planning
- human monitoring and plan recognition
- mixed-initiative planning and adjustable autonomy
- cognitive modeling, social interaction, and theory of mind
- human-in-the-loop planning
- behavior transparency and explainability
- explanation of planning and learning models
- planning for co-bots and human-robot teaming
- plan-based interactive robotic systems
- safety, ethics, and transparency in robot planning and human monitoring
- benchmarking planning domains for robots and humans

## Author Guidelines
Authors may submit long papers (8 pages plus up to one page of references) or short papers (4 pages plus up to one page of references). The type of paper must be indicated at submission time. Both long and short papers will be reviewed against the standard criteria of relevance, originality, significance, clarity and soundness, and are expected to meet the high standards set by ICAPS. Short papers may be of narrower scope. For example, they can either address a highly specific issue, or propose/evaluate a small, yet important, extension of previous work or a new idea.

Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant unique content. Papers submitted to ICAPS 2023 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2023 review period, nor may be already under review or published in other conferences or journals. Over-length papers will be rejected without review.

## Ethical/Societal Impact

It is optional for authors to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement can be included in either the main body pages or the reference page. If such a statement is not included in the paper but the reviewers deem that such a statement is necessary, then the authors will be asked to provide one during the author response period for review. If the paper is accepted, the statement provided will need to be incorporated in the camera-ready version.

## Submission Instructions
All submissions will be made electronically, through the [EasyChair conference system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps23). Submitted PDF papers should be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, adhere to the page limits of the relevant track CFP/submission type (long or short), and follow the [AAAI author kit instructions for formatting](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AnonymousSubmission23.zip).

In addition to the submitted PDF paper, authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs, additional experimental results) for their paper. Please make sure that the supporting material is also anonymized. Papers should be self-contained; reviewers are encouraged, but not obligated, to consider supporting material in their decision.

The proceedings will be published by AAAI Press. All accepted papers will be published in the main conference proceedings and will be presented orally at the conference (full papers will be allocated more time).
## Important Dates
We have arranged our schedule to allow for the revision and resubmission of papers rejected from AAAI 2023.

- November 25, 2022 - Abstracts due (electronic submission)
- November 30, 2022 - Full papers due (electronic submission, PDF)
- January 16-19, 2023 - Author feedback period
- February 4, 2023 - Notification of acceptance or rejection

The reference timezone for all deadlines is UTC-12. That is, as long as there is still some place anywhere in the world where the deadline has not yet passed, you are on time!
