# Call for Papers: ICAPS 2023

ICAPS 2023, the 33rd International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, will take place in Prague, July 8-13, 2023. ICAPS 2023 will be part of the ICAPS conference series, the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and applications of intelligent planning and scheduling technology. 

ICAPS 2023 will feature 4 different tracks:

- Main Track (see below)
- [Industry and Applications Track](https://icaps2023.github.io/calls/application_track/)
- [Planning and Learning Track](https://icaps2023.github.io/calls/learning_track/)
- [Robotics Track](https://icaps2023.github.io/calls/robotics_track/)

Additionally, the ICAPS program will include a journal track, demonstrations, workshops, and tutorials, each having separate submission and notification dates, to be announced separately.

The ICAPS 2023 program committee invites paper submissions related to automated planning and scheduling. Relevant contributions include but are not limited to:

- Theoretical foundations of planning and scheduling
- Classical planning techniques and analysis
- Knowledge representation for planning and scheduling
- Planning with time and resources
- Plan and schedule execution, monitoring, and repair
- Continual, on-line, and real-time planning and scheduling
- Plan recognition, plan management, and goal reasoning
- Uncertainty and stochasticity in planning and scheduling
- Partially observable and unobservable domains
- Conformant, contingent, and adversarial planning
- Multi-agent and distributed planning
- Planning and scheduling with continuous state and action spaces
- Planning and scheduling with mixed continuous and discrete states/actions/decisions
- Robot planning and scheduling (see also the special track)
- Knowledge acquisition and engineering for planning and scheduling
- Applications and case studies of planning and scheduling techniques (see also the special track)
- Learning for planning and scheduling (see also special the track)
- Human-aware planning and scheduling


## Author Guidelines

Authors may submit technical papers or position papers. Technical papers are expected to report on substantial original research, while position papers are expected to discuss ideas and concepts, for instance, via thoughtful critiques or bold new perspectives of the field, historical perspectives and analysis, or technical discussions of various implementation techniques. Both technical and position papers can be long (8 pages AAAI style plus up to one page of references) or short (4 pages plus up to one page of references).  The type of paper must be indicated at submission time. All papers, regardless of length, will be reviewed against the standard criteria of relevance, originality, significance, clarity, soundness, and are expected to meet the same high standards set by ICAPS. Short papers may be of narrower scope, for example by addressing a highly specific issue, or proposing or evaluating a small, yet important, extension of previous work or new idea. Over length papers will be rejected without review.

Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant unique content. Papers submitted to ICAPS 2023 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2023 review period nor may they be already under review, accepted, or published in other conferences or journals. 

## Best paper fast-track to top AI journals

Following the ICAPS tradition, in ICAPS 2023 we will give a best paper and best student paper awards. These papers will also receive an invitation to submit an extended version to either the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) or the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ). 

## Ethical/Societal Impact

It is optional for authors to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement can be included in either the main body pages or the reference page. If such a statement is not included in the paper but the reviewers deem that such a statement is necessary, then the authors will be asked to provide one during the author response period for review. If the paper is accepted, the statement provided will need to be incorporated in the camera-ready version.


## Submission Instructions

All submissions will be made electronically, through the [EasyChair conference system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps23).

Submitted PDF papers should be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, adhere to the page limits of the relevant track CFP/submission type (long or short), and follow the [AAAI author kit instructions for formatting](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit23.zip). 

In addition to the submitted PDF paper, authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs, additional experimental results) for their paper. Please make sure that the supporting material is also anonymized. Papers should be self-contained; reviewers are encouraged, but not obligated, to consider supporting material in their decisions.


## Important Dates

We have arranged our schedule to allow for the revision and resubmission of papers rejected from AAAI 2023.

- November 25, 2022 - Abstracts due (electronic submission)
- November 30, 2022 - Full papers due (electronic submission, PDF)
- January 16-19, 2023 - Author feedback period
- February 4, 2023 - Notification of acceptance or rejection

The reference timezone for all deadlines is UTC-12. That is, as long as there is still some place anywhere in the world where the deadline has not yet passed, you are on time!
