# ICAPS 2025 Call for Tutorial Proposals

**Submission Deadline: 27 April 2025**

The Organizing Committee for the 35th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2025) invites proposals for its Tutorial Program. Tutorials offer the attendees a review of a specific subfield by a leading expert. Participation in the tutorials is free for all ICAPS participants.

We welcome proposals in all areas related to AI planning and scheduling, and highly encourage topics that have not appeared in recent ICAPS tutorials. This year, given the co-location with KR 2025 and CPAIOR 2025, we particularly welcome tutorial proposals covering topics at the intersection of planning & scheduling with knowledge representation & reasoning, constraint programming or operations research.

We accept both introductory tutorials and more advanced tutorials covering recent advances in depth and encourage proposals that address techniques of relevance to planning and scheduling, even if planning and scheduling is not the main focus of the proposed tutorial. Proposals could target, for example,

- relevant techniques and best practices in Software Engineering for developing and testing critical components in planning and scheduling technology,
- recent advances in neuro-symbolic methods and frameworks, including the underlying theory (e.g. provenance semirings) for propagating information across the neural-symbolic interface that can demonstrably be integrated with solvers for planning and scheduling problems,
- methodologies involving the use of generative AI models, such as large language models (LLM), for planning and scheduling,
- applications of machine learning and reinforcement learning theory and algorithms into planning and scheduling technology,
- novel formulations and algorithms that address scalable planning and robust control of complex dynamical systems composed by multiple devices or agents, including sensors or state estimation procedures based on machine learning,
- recent algorithmic and theoretical advances in deterministic and stochastic optimization with the potential to inform the development of novel methods for planning and scheduling,
- novel methods, theoretical results, and solver architectures for Boolean Satisfiability and other problems related to constraint satisfaction,
- recent advances in general algorithms for stream processing and sketching with potential applications in planning and scheduling technology,
- novel algorithms in (approximate) dynamic programming and search with exciting applications in planning and scheduling,
- other relevant techniques in knowledge representation and reasoning.

We encourage tutorials that (i) include a hands-on session that can be completed remotely or asynchronously, allowing participants to experiment with useful tools, or (ii) experiment with algorithmic components, to deepen the participants' understanding of the topic. We especially welcome tutorials that collaborate with a workshop, such that the tutorial provides some introductory material that can be later discussed at the workshop.

**Tutorial Proposals**

Tutorial Submissions should include the tutorial's title, type (advanced or introductory), summary, outline, and expected length (half-day or quarter-day) as well as a short CV of the proposer(s), including a list of significant publications and/or prior tutorial experience. The proposal should not exceed two pages.

Tutorial proposals should be submitted by email, in PDF, to the Tutorial Chairs with the subject "Tutorial Proposal for ICAPS-25" no later than April 27th 2025, AoE. Organizers of tutorials will be notified by email of the acceptance or rejection of their proposal by May 11th 2025.

**Summary of Important Dates**

The deadline for submission of proposals is 27 April 2025.

Notification of tutorial acceptance: 11 May 2025.

Tutorial dates: 10-11 November 2025 (together with ICAPS-25 Workshops).
