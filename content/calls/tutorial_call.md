# ICAPS 2024 Call for Tutorial Proposals:
**Submission Deadline: March 1st, 2024**

The Organizing Committee for the 34th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2024) 
invites proposals for its Tutorial Program. Tutorials offer the attendees a review of a specific subfield by a leading 
expert. Participation in the tutorials is free for all ICAPS participants.

We welcome proposals in all areas related to AI planning and scheduling, and highly encourage topics that have not 
appeared in recent ICAPS tutorials. We accept both introductory tutorials, and more advanced tutorials covering 
recent advances in depth. We explicitly encourage proposals that address techniques of relevance to planning and 
scheduling, even if planning and scheduling is not the main focus of the proposed tutorial. Proposals could target, 
for example,

- relevant techniques and best practices in Software Engineering for developing and testing critical components in 
planning & scheduling technology,
- recent advances in neurosymbolic methods and frameworks, including the underlying theory (e.g. provenance semirings) 
for propagating information across the neural-symbolic interface, that can demonstrably be integrated with solvers for 
planning and scheduling problems,
- applications of machine learning and reinforcement learning theory and algorithms into planning and scheduling 
technology,
- novel formulations and algorithms that address scalable planning and robust control of complex dynamical systems 
composed by multiple devices or agents, including sensors or state estimation procedures based on machine learning,
- recent algorithmic and theoretical advances in deterministic and stochastic optimization with potential to inform 
the development of novel methods for planning and scheduling,
- novel methods, theoretical results and solver architectures for Boolean Satisfiability and other problems related to 
constraint satisfaction,
- recent advances in general algorithms for stream processing and sketching with potential applications in planning and 
scheduling technology,
- novel algorithms in (approximate) dynamic programming and search with exciting applications on planning and 
scheduling,
- other relevant techniques in knowledge representation and reasoning.

We encourage tutorials that (i) include a hands-on session that can be completed remotely or asynchronously, allowing 
participants to experiment with useful tools, or (ii) experiment with algorithmic components, to deepen the 
participants' understanding of the topic. We especially welcome tutorials that collaborate with a workshop, such that 
the tutorial provides some introductory material that can be later discussed at the workshop.

**Tutorial Proposals**

Tutorial Submissions should include the tutorial's title, type (advanced or introductory), summary, outline, and 
expected length (half-day or quarter-day) as well as a short CV of the proposer(s), including a list of significant 
publications and/or prior tutorial experience. The proposal should not exceed two pages.

Tutorial proposals should be submitted by email, in PDF, to the Tutorial Chairs with subject "Tutorial Proposal for 
ICAPS-24" no later than March 1st 2024, AoE. Organizers of tutorials will be notified by email of the acceptance or 
rejection of their proposal by March 18th 2024.

**Summary of Important Dates**

Deadline for submission of proposals: March 1st, 2024.

Notification of tutorial acceptance: March 18th, 2024.

Tutorial dates: June 2-3, 2024 (together with ICAPS-24 Workshops).

**Tutorial Program Chairs**

The tutorial chairs are

 - Miquel Ramirez (University of Melbourne, Dept. Electric and Electronic Engineering)
 - Christina N. Burt (Fortescue Metals Group, Perth, Australia)

Please direct all questions about the tutorial program to the tutorial program chairs via
