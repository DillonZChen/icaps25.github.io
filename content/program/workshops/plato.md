# PLanning And onTology wOrkshop (PLATO)

ICAPS'23 Workshop \
Prague, Czech Republic \
July 9-10, 2023

## Aim and Scope of the Workshop

Automated Planning and Ontology are two well-established fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The former investigates techniques to formally model and reason about the effects of actions, and decide the combinations of actions that allow an agent to achieve goals. The latter investigates techniques to formally define knowledge (by formally describing domain entities and their interrelations), allowing agents to process information about objects, and events, and incrementally build and verify beliefs. 

Both Automated Planning and Ontology generally rely on logic to model knowledge and organize reasoning mechanisms. They support the development of cognitive capabilities that autonomous agents need to effectively act in the real world. In this context, the PLanning And onTology wOrkshop (PLATO) aims at bringing together researchers in these two fields of AI to address new research challenges, share their experiences, and learn from each other. 

The workshop aims at investigating the synergetic contributions of technologies and methods from these two fields. There are examples in the literature that have investigated the use of Ontology to generate planning models, find effective plans, and contextualize plans and action execution to domain features. 

## Topics of Interest

The workshop is open to both application and theoretical contributions that see the integration of ontology and planning as a mechanism to enhance the efficacy of AI-based solutions. Here is a list of (some) topics: 

- Ontological analysis of concepts related to planning/scheduling (e.g., capability, capacity, action, etc)
- Domain ontologies supporting tasks related to planning/scheduling
- Reuse of foundational ontologies (e.g., DOLCE, BFO, UFO) in order to strive the interoperability among multiple ontologies, among other goals
- Semantic Web ontologies and technologies for reasoning, (FAIR) data management, interoperability, etc
- Ontologies supporting the interoperability of heterogeneous planning frameworks
- Ontologies supporting Plan and Schedule Execution
- Plan Recognition, plan management, and goal reasoning
- Partially observable and unobservable domains
- Knowledge acquisition and engineering for planning and scheduling
- Situation assessment for contextualized planning decisions
- Explainability of plans and planning models
- Trustworthy, safety, and ethics in planning
- Benchmarking and evaluation metrics of plans and plan-based controllers
- Out-of-the-box research challenges at the intersection between Automated Planning and Ontology


## Important Dates

- Submission: **March 31, 2023 (EXTENDED)**
- Notification: May 2, 2023
- Camera-ready: May 27, 2023
- Workshop: July 9-10, 2023
- Conference: July 8-13, 2023

The reference time-zone for all deadlines is **UTC-12**. Your submissions will be on time so long as there is still some place in the world where the deadline has not yet passed.

## Submission Details

We welcome two categories of paper submission:
- **Short papers** - _6 pages_ (including references) formatted as LNCS one-column paper. These should describe concrete problems, open issues concerning planning and ontology, or methodologies/approaches pointing out the added values of the integration between planning and ontology.
- **Full papers** - _13 pages_ (including references) formatted as LNCS one-column paper. These should report work-in-progress, novel designed technologies or systems relying on the integration of panning and ontology.


Submissions should be made in PDF through **EasyChair** using the link [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=plato2023](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=plato2023).

Authors of **accepted short and full papers** will give a talk about their work during the workshop. 

Papers should be formatted according to **CEUR-WS style**. From 2022 onwards, CEUR-WS requires that authors use the new **CEUR-ART style** for writing papers. An **Overleaf template** for **LaTeX** users is available at the following link: [https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwhxnqcghhdt](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwhxnqcghhdt). It is also possible to download an offline version with the style files from [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip). More information on the [CEUR-WS website](http://ceur-ws.org/index.html).

### Workshop Proceedings

Accepted papers will be published with **CEUR-WS proceedings**, under the [**IAOA series**](https://ceur-ws.org/iaoa.html).
