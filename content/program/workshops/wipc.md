# Workshop on the International Planning Competition (WIPC 2024)

6th ICAPS Workshop on the International Planning Competition (WIPC 2024) \
Banff, Alberta, Canada \
June 2-3, 2024


| Schedule            |          |

| Submission          | April 2  |
| Notification        | April 8  |
| Camera Ready        | April 22 |

## Aim and Scope of the Workshop

The International Planning Competition (IPC) is held every few years in the
context of ICAPS. It empirically evaluates state-of-the-art planning systems on
a number of benchmark problems. The goals of the IPC are to promote planning
research, highlight challenges in the planning community and provide new and
interesting problems as benchmarks for future research. The IPC has an important
role in the ICAPS community, being a forum to compare different algorithmic
ideas and implementations, and setting standards for research and evaluation in
the area.

Similar to the lineage of IPC workshops organised at ICAPS 2003, 2007, 2012,
2015, and 2019 this workshop aims to review the current status of the IPC,
analyze the results of the last IPC (2023), and provide a venue for discussing
aspects that will be helpful for preparing forthcoming competitions.


## Topics of Interest

Topics of interests include but are not limited to:

- Past, present and future of the IPC
- Tracks: Proposing new and/or revising the current tracks
- Domain Definition Languages: benefits and limitations. Should
  larger subsets of PDDL or RDDL be considered in next editions of the
  IPC? Should the input languages evolve in some way?
- Benchmark Domains: Discussion/Analysis of existing domains. Are IPC benchmarks a
  good standard for evaluation of planners?  How should instances be chosen for the
  competition?
- Evaluation Metrics: Should we adapt the metrics used for evaluating the performance
  of planners? How should the winners of the competition be decided?
- Results: interpretation of past results, new ideas about how to analyze/compare the
  performance of planners beyond the score of the competition.
- Rules: Should portfolios be given a special treatment? Should there be any limits on
  re-using code from others?
- Tools: Can we automate large parts of the IPC to make organising an IPC track easier?


# Submissions

We encourage submissions in three formats. All submissions should be accompanied by a paper in [AAAI style](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit23.zip). In all tracks you can choose the length of your submission freely between 1-8 pages + one page for references. Please choose a length appropriate for the format of your submission.
- long presentations have a ~20 minute slot, including discussions. We expect most papers for this format will make use of all 8 pages.
- short presentations have a ~10 minute slot, including discussions. We expect the average paper in this format will have around 4 pages.
- very short presentations have a ~5 minute slot, including discussion.  We expect submissions to consist of an idea that can be presented on 1-2 slides but lead to some discussion, like a suggestion for a new track or metric. Submissions in this track should consist of a title and abstract, so no PDF submission is required (though it is also welcomed).

(We will adjust the length of the time slots according to the number of accepted papers.)

As suggested by the list of topics, we encourage the submission of position papers as well as other submissions that do not fit the mold of a typical conference paper.

Paper submissions will be handled in OpenReview ([https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2024/Workshop/WIPC](https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2024/Workshop/WIPC)). The review process will be single blind for reviewers and double blind for the general public. All reviews of accepted papers will be made public via the OpenReview system.
