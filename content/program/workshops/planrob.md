# Planning and Robotics (PlanRob 2024)

ICAPS'24 Workshop \
Banff, Alberta, Canada \
June 2-3, 2024

## Aim and Scope of the Workshop

AI Planning & Scheduling (P&S) methods are key to enabling intelligent robots to perform autonomous, flexible, and interactive behaviours. Researchers in the P&S community have continued to develop approaches and produce planners, representations, as well as heuristics that robotics researchers can make use of. However, there remain numerous challenges complicating the uptake, use and successful integration of P&S technology in robotics, many of which have been addressed by robotics researchers with novel solutions. Strong collaboration and synergy between researchers in both communities is vital to the continued growth of the fields in a way that provide mutual benefits to the two communities. To foster this, the PlanRob workshop aims to provide a stable, long-term forum (having been held annually at ICAPS since 2013) where researchers from both the P&S and Robotics communities can openly discuss relevant issues, research and development progress, future directions and open challenges related to P&S when applied to Robotics. In addition to the usual paper submissions, the workshop’s format naturally lends itself to preliminary results, position papers as well as to work focused on challenges in using and integrating planners in robotics systems.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- human-aware planning and execution in human-robot interaction,
- real-world planning applications for autonomous and intelligent robots,
- planning domain representations for robotics applications,
- optimising behaviour in large scale automated or semi-automated systems,
- integrated planning and execution in robot architectures,
- learning methods for robot planning and scheduling,
- P&S methods for optimisation and adaptation in robotics,
- mission, path, and motion planning for robots,
- formal methods for robot planning and control,
- challenges and solutions in using P&S technology in robotics,
- open problems for P&S in robotics,
- coordination of multi-robot teams,
- benchmark planning domains for robots,
- adversarial action planning in competitive robot domains,
- mixed-initiative planning and sliding autonomy for robotic systems.


## Important Dates

- Paper submission: **March 10, 2024**
- Notification of acceptance: **March 24, 2023**
- Camera-ready version due: **April 21**
- Workshop Date: **June 2-3**

The reference time-zone for all deadlines is UTC-12: Your submissions will be on time so long as there is still some place in the world where the deadline has not yet passed.

## Submission Details

There are two types of submissions: 

- short position papers (four pages)
- regular papers (up to 10 pages)

Papers may have an additional page containing references. Regular papers may be scheduled with more time in the final program. A poster session may be considered to provide a further presentation opportunity.

The guidelines for formatting are the same as is used for ICAPS 2024 papers (typeset in the AAAI style as described at: [http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php](http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php)), but with the AAAI copyright removed. The papers must be submitted in PDF format via the EasyChair system ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icapswsplanrob24](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icapswsplanrob24)).

Please note that papers under review (e.g. which have been submitted to IJCAI-2024) are also welcome, however, in order to avoid potential conflicts, these manuscripts should be prepared as anonymous submissions for a double blind reviewing process.

Accepted papers will be published on the workshop's website.

The organisers are investigating the availability of journal editors in order to invite a selection of accepted papers from the workshop to a special issue or post-proceedings volume.
