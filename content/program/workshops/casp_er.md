# Constraint And Satisfiability-based Planning: an Exploratory Research Workshop (CASP:ER 2025)

Despite the widespread adoption of heuristic search and learning-based approaches in automated planning, Constraint and Satisfiability-based Planning (CSP/SAT-based Planning) remains a viable and promising paradigm. Historically, CSP and SAT approaches have demonstrated strong theoretical foundations and practical success in various domains. However, their usage has diminished in recent years due to the rise of alternative methods. The CASP:ER workshop aims to revisit and reinforce the relevance of CSP/SAT-based planning by showcasing recent advancements, discussing its applicability, and identifying opportunities for renewed adoption.

A surge of research on the topic of CSP/SAT-based planning in recent years has proven that it is far from obsolete. Advances in constraint programming, SAT solvers, and hybrid methodologies suggest that these techniques still have much to offer.
The objectives of the workshop are thus as follows: (i) highlight recent breakthroughs in \csp/\sat-based planning and their impact on the field, (ii) explore novel applications where constraint-based planning remains competitive or superior, (iii) foster discussions on integrating CSP/SAT methods with modern AI approaches, such as machine learning and heuristic search (iv) bring together researchers and practitioners interested in constraint-based reasoning for planning, and (v) identify key challenges and future research directions that can rejuvenate interest in CSP/SAT-based planning.



## Important Dates
This year's first edition of CASP:ER will be held on November 10th or 11th, 2025, as a workshop co-located with ICAPS 2025.
Important dates
 - Paper submission June 27th, 2025
 - Notification    	August 1st, 2025
 - Camera-ready    	August 30th, 2025
 - Workshop: November 10th or 11th, 2025 (TBA)

## Call for contributions

We accept two types of contributions: both reports on previouly published work as well as original research.

1. Abstracts for Presentations. The abstract (1 page) reports on previously published work. The abstract should briefly summarise that work. The submission must include a link to the original publication.
2. Extended abstracts  (5 pages + references) containing original work on CSP- or SAT-based Planning.

Both types of contributions will be presented with talks. Invited talks may complement the presentations of contributed papers.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

    automata theory
    automated reasoning
    automated planning and scheduling
    controller synthesis
    formal specification languages
    formal verification
    game theory
    hybrid and discrete systems
    logics in computer science
    neurosymbolic approaches
    logics for neural networks
    neural networks for logic
    reactive synthesis
    runtime verification and monitoring
    satisfiability modulo theories and theorem proving
    specification and verification of machine/deep learning systems
    tools and applications

Contributed papers can present recent results at the border of the two fields, new research directions, challenges and perspectives. Presentation of results recently published in other scientific journals or conferences is also welcome.

We plan to include all papers in the Proceedings of the event, published at CEUR Workshop Proceedings . CEUR WS proceedings are archival proceedings indexed by DBLP and Scopus.
Submissions

Submitted papers should not exceed five (5) pages plus references. Authors are asked to use the Overlay-specific CEURART LaTeX style, which will be made available soon. Authors of accepted papers will have the possibility to extend their submissions for the final camera-ready version to eight (8) pages plus references.

Submissions must be in PDF format and will be handled via EasyChair at the following address: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=overlay2025 .
