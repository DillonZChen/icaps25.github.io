# ICAPS 2023 Doctoral Consortium

The Doctoral Consortium (DC) is intended to give Ph.D. students the opportunity to closely interact with established researchers and get feedback on their research, provide advice on career possibilities and build a professional network, improving the cohesion of new researchers with the ICAPS community.

The DC is open to all doctoral student attendees of the conference and will take place on **July 8th** (the day before ICAPS workshops and tutorials). Registering for the Doctoral Consortium will be part of the registration process for the conference and all students are invited to take part in it.


## Mentoring Program

As part of the Doctoral Consortium, ICAPS will offer a Mentoring Program. The Mentoring Program is designed to provide Ph.D. students with an opportunity for in-depth advice by senior members of the field regarding careers and research skills. Each student accepted to the program will be matched with an established researcher in the field who will provide research and career management advice at the **Doctoral Consortium day**.

We encourage current doctoral students (students whose Ph.D. is in progress) to apply for the Mentoring Program. Students do not need to be accepted into the Mentoring Program to attend and participate in the Doctoral Consortium.

  <h3>Looking for Serendipity – Where (Some) Research Questions Come From?</h3>
  <p>Serendipity is an unplanned fortunate discovery. In this talk, I will describe how I have stumbled on some very interesting research questions by paying attention to small details. I will then try to give some general advice on how to look for interesting research questions in your own work.</p>
