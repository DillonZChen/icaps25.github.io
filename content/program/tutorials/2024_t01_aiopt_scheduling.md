# Tutorial 01 - AI and Optimization for Scheduling

## Abstract

Scheduling problems arise in various areas, including business, engineering, healthcare, and others. In this tutorial, 
we will first present several scheduling problems and case studies from various application domains, such as project 
scheduling, production planning and scheduling, employee scheduling, and timetabling. We will then provide an overview 
of different methods for solving such problems. The topics covered will include solver-independent modeling, constraint 
programming, metaheuristic methods, and hybrid techniques. In the second part of the tutorial, we will discuss methods 
that use machine learning techniques for automatic algorithm selection and heuristic algorithm design. We will 
demonstrate the application of these techniques in several real-world domains.
