# Abstract

The goal of the tutorial is to familiarise the audience with the theorethical and practical
aspects of devising multiple plans for classical planning problems. We will motivate the need
for such planners from application perspective, formally define the respective computational
problems, as well as describe the existing approaches to solving these problems. We will
finish with a hands-on session on using the existing planners.

The tutorial is aimed at ICAPS audience, familiar with classical planning. We hope that the tutorial will help both the 
practitioners who want to use these tools in applications and the tools builders interested in creating efficient planners.

**Michael Katz** is a principal researcher at IBM T.J.Watson Research Center, NY, USA.
His primary research interest is in domain-independent planning and in the integration
of planning and RL. He received his PhD for a dissertation on heuristics for domainindependent
planning from Technion in 2010. He was a co-organizer of the 2011,
2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2022 H(S)DIP workshops, as well as of five of the
six editions (including the first) of PRL workshop 2020-2023. He was a program chair
of ICAPS 2021. He co-organized IJCAI 2021 and AAAI 2022 tutorials AI Planning:
Theory and Practice. He co-authored 50+ publications in various premier research
conferences, including AAAI, ICAPS, IJCAI, IROS, and journals like JAIR and AIJ.

**Junkyu Lee** is a research scientist at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, NY, USA.
He received his PhD at University of California, Irvine in 2020, and had over 6 years
of experience in systems engineering in the industry. His primary research interest
is causal reasoning and graphical model algorithms for sequential decision making
and augmenting foundation models with reasoning capability. He co-authored over
10 publications in AAAI, UAI, IJCAI, NeuRIPS, and regularly serves as a Program
Committee of AAAI, IJCAI, NeuRIPS, ICML, ICLR, and others.

**David Speck** is a postdoctoral researcher at Link¨oping University in Sweden, specializing
in domain-independent planning. He received his PhD from the University of
Freiburg in Germany in 2022 and has authored 19 peer-reviewed publications at prestigious
conferences such as AAAI, ICAPS, and ECAI. Serving as a program committee
member and reviewer for renowned AI conferences such as AAAI, ICAPS, IJCAI,
and ECAI shows his active involvement in the field. In addition, he co-organized the
HSDIP workshop at ICAPS in 2020 and 2021. Finally, he has won multiple competitions
in the field of AI, including the Probabilistic International Planning Competition
(IPC) in 2018 and the Optimal Track of the IPC 2023.
