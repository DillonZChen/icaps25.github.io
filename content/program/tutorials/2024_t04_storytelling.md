# Tutorial 04 - Planning for Storytelling

## Abstract

In this tutorial we will demonstrate the role that planning, or planning-based representations, can play in narrative
generation methods. The plan becomes the representation of the story and also that of the story world, and thus we use
Planning to create logical, believable, and coherent stories (narratives) in a variety of domains. We will cover several
techniques, including modern approaches that make use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and provide the opportunity for
attendees to play with the technology themselves live.

## About the authors

**Nisha Simon** is a PhD candidate at Queen’s University under the supervision of Prof. Christian Muise, and a Teaching
Assistant with the School of Computing. Her interests are in researching structured learning from unstructured
text. Before beginning her PhD degree program, she worked as a Systems Analyst and Web Developer for several years.
Storytelling with Automated Planning is a key part of her current research. When she is not teaching Transformer-based
Models how to tell logical, coherent and believable stories, she enjoys reading, painting, and listening to music.

**Christian Muise** is an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at Queen's University. His research focuses on
a variety of automated planning techniques, with a specialty in reasoning under uncertainty and model acquisition. He
has presented multiple ICAPS tutorials in the past (on Planning.Domains and model acquisition), and is the chief
architect of several automated planning frameworks (including planning.domains and planutils).

**Rogelio E. Cardona-Rivera** is an Assistant Professor in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah.
His research focuses on the design of games, systems where users direct an unfolding experience by taking on
ludic/dramatic roles. He has a strong track-record of publishing in the space of synthesizing narratives.

**Arnav Jhala** is an associate professor of Computer Science at NC State University. Prof. Jhala’s research group
investigates computational structures and methods that are useful in representing and mediating human interpretation
and communication of narrative in interactive visual media, such as film and games. The Jhala research group uses
symbolic and probabilistic tools to represent and construct coherent visual discourse and apply generative techniques
for automated and semi-automated tools to interpret and collaboratively create visual narratives.

**Julie Porteous** is an Associate Professor in the School of Computing Technologies at RMIT University, Melbourne.
She is a long-standing member of the ICAPS community and her work has had an emphasis on (1) Automated Planning; (2)
Interactive Narratives (application of automated planning to narrative generation); (3) Automated acquisition of AI
planning domain models; and (4) Authoring tools for Interactive Narratives.

**R. Michael Young** is Professor and Chair of the Division of Games, an Adjunct Professor in the School of Computing
and an Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT, where he also directs the
Liquid Narrative research group. Together with his students and research staff, his work in the Liquid Narrative group
focuses on the development of computational models of interactive narrative with applications to computer games,
educational and training systems and virtual environments.

**Patrik Haslum** is an Associate Professor at the Australian National University, where he focuses on a wide variety
of research in automated planning. Most notably for this tutorial, Dr Haslum has a track record of automated story
telling through the lens of automated planning, and continues to pursue avenues of research in this area.
