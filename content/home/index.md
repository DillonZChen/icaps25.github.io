The International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) is the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and applications of 
intelligent and automated planning and scheduling technology. ICAPS 2025 is part of the [ICAPS conference series](https://www.icaps-conference.org/conference-series/). ICAPS 2025, the 35th International Conference on Automated 
Planning and Scheduling, will take place in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in November 2025. ICAPS invites paper submissions 
related to automated planning and scheduling. Relevant contributions include, but are not limited to:

- Theoretical and empirical studies of planning and scheduling problems and algorithms;
- Novel techniques and approaches that extend the scope and scale of problems that can be solved;
- Novel tools and frameworks for analysing and verifying the properties of systems executing plans, policies or schedules;
- Studies of applying automated planning and scheduling technologies to significant problems with deep technical insight.

**ICAPS 2025** will be collocated with the following events:

- [KR-2025](https://kr.org/): The 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning.
- [CPAIOR-2025](https://cpaior.org/): The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research.
- A summer school.

The following video has been prepared by the Program Committee to walk interested parties through the major changes 
in the organization of the conference with respect to previous editions

## Call for Papers Advertised - 13th September 2024

The ICAPS 2025 program committee has got its stuff together and is happy to announce that the Call for Papers is 
now available. We expect to disseminate the call further over the next few days.

We would like to thank to all those who have volunteered to help us with the organisation of the conference. We will be 
in touch really soon. 

## Community Update - 2nd September 2024

The ICAPS 2025 program committee is working on preparing the Call for Papers for the Conference which we expect to
start disseminating very soon. In the meantime, we have prepared a community update to explain upcoming changes to
the conference. These changes affect how papers will be submitted, how they will be reviewed, and how the program 
committee will be formed.

Our first update is a video presentation explaining the result of our conference co-design process with the ICAPS council. 
The co-design impacts the reviewing and submission protocols at ICAPS in 2025 and is recommended for all members of the 
ICAPS community. You can find the video [on this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9QyvOapek).

Our second update is about how to get involved with ICAPS 2025. Following a successful initiative in 2024, we will ask 
community members to volunteer for roles on the ICAPS 2025 program committee. Openings are available for Topic Chairs, 
Area Chairs, and Reviewers. A description of each of these roles can be found [here](/organization/roles_and_guidelines).
If you want to volunteer before we start our mailing campaign, please submit an expression of interest via the Google 
form [on this link](https://forms.gle/Cv3BavDyA6PhNa3w5).

Our third update covers the introduction of a more structured classification system for submissions, which extends and 
evolves the system introduced at ICAPS 2024. These changes have several goals: (i) to clarify the scope and types of 
contributions relevant to the conference, (ii) to broaden participation in the conference, and (iii) to increase the 
likelihood that expert reviewers and area chairs are matched to appropriate submissions by OpenReview and our in-house 
automated assignment systems. You can find more information about our paper classification system in its 
[dedicated section](/organization/paper_classification_system) on the ICAPS 2025 website.
