The International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) is the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and applications of intelligent and automated planning and scheduling technology. ICAPS 2025 is part of the [ICAPS conference series](https://www.icaps-conference.org/conference-series/). ICAPS 2025, the 35th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, will take place in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in November 2025.

The ICAPS 2025 program committee invites paper submissions related to automated planning and scheduling. Relevant contributions include, but are not limited to:

- Theoretical and empirical studies of planning and scheduling problems and algorithms;
- Novel techniques and approaches that extend the scope and scale of problems that can be solved;
- Analytic and implemented tools supporting automated planning and scheduling;
- Studies of applying automated planning and scheduling technologies to significant problems with deep technical insight.

**ICAPS 2025** will be collocated with [22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR-2025)](https://kr.org/) (IWPSS, July 7-8)
