# Type Tags

Submissions can be tagged with oneof the following tags that describe the type of content that readers will
find in the paper. We note that the authors in papers that present several types of contributions, will need to decide
which is the _crucial_ one, that is, the one that justifies acceptance into ICAPS 2025.

- Theoretical 
  - The paper reports contributions that broaden the set of analytical tools to study problems and algorithms. 
  - Examples of contributions in this category would be, but are not limited to: complexity results, 
    expressiveness/compilations, new frameworks
- Algorithmic 
  - The paper reports contributions that add new methodologies and algorithms to solve planning problems.
  - Examples of contributions in this category would be, but are not limited to: optimisations/specializations of 
    existing algorithms, propagators, algorithms for subproblems (branching decisions, decomposition approaches)
- Models 
  - The paper discusses new representations of solutions or elements of planning problems. 
  - Examples of contributions in this category would be, but are not limited to: new mathematical frameworks for 
    existing problems or original descriptions of new problems, refinements in existing frameworks for knowledge 
    representation about actions, goals, or states.
- Position Paper
  - The paper presents novel research questions, or reflects on the status and approaches to existing research questions.
  - Examples of contributions in this category would be: meta-analysis of research trends, results, benchmarks.

# Subject Tags

To describe the paper subject(s), that is the crucial background and knowledge necessary to make sense out of
the paper, we have borrow the ontology used by IJCAI 2024. Below is the list of keywords in IJCAI 2024 classification
system which we have found to be most relevant to submissions to ICAPS. Please let us know if you would like to add
a new category by writing [to our mailing list](mailto:icaps25pc@googlegroups.com)
