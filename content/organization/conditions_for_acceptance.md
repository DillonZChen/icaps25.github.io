# Conditions for Acceptance

We give below the criteria used to **consider** a paper for acceptance which we structure as a questionnaire, which
we borrow from [Elsevier's Artificial Intelligence Journal](https://aij.ijcai.org/reviewing-form/) review form. These
questions provide a set of guidelines to interrogate whether submissions have the qualities that demonstrate a level
of achievement that strongly suggests the paper shold be accepted, and also a template for 
[ACs](/organization/roles_and_guidelines) to write their recommendations to the TCs and the Program Chairs. 

Papers that receive more positive responses than negative responses will be more likely to be accepted. 

## Questionnaire

The ACs are invited to copy and paste the structure below on their meta-reviews and add their 
detailed comments to flesh out their answers.

### Content

1. Is the paper technically sound?

2. Does it show sufficient applicability to the Topic descriptor chosen?

3. Does it place new results in appropriate context with earlier work?

4. Is the paper sufficiently novel? (A paper is novel if the results it describes were not previously published by 
other authors, and were not previously published by the same authors in any archival journal or conference.)

5. Is the paper complete? (Generally, a paper is complete if it includes all relevant proofs and/or experimental data, 
a thorough  discussion of connections with the existing literature, and a convincing discussion of the motivations 
and implications of the presented work.)

6. Does anything need to be added or deleted?

7. Is the result important enough to warrant publication in the proceedings and invite the authors to ICAPS 2025?

### Form

1. Does the abstract adequately reflect the contents?

2. Are the summary and conclusions adequate?

3. Does it contain adequate references to previous work?

4. Does it explain clearly what was done that is new?

5. Does it clearly indicate why this work is important?

6. Is the English satisfactory?

7. Is the presentation otherwise satisfactory?

8. Are there an appropriate number of figures and examples?

9. Do the figures and examples help clarify the concepts in the paper?
