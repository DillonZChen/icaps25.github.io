All submissions will be made electronically, through the [EasyChair conference system]<!---(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps23).-->.

Submitted PDF papers should be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, adhere to the page limits of the relevant track CFP/submission type (long or short), and follow the [AAAI author kit instructions for formatting]<!---(https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit24.zip).-->.

In addition to the submitted PDF paper, authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs, additional experimental results) for their paper. Please make sure that the supporting material is also anonymised. Papers should be self-contained; reviewers are encouraged, but not obligated, to consider supporting material in their decisions.
