# Tutorial 02 - Finding Multiple Plans for Classical Planning Problems

## Abstract

The goal of the tutorial is to familiarise the audience with the theoretical and practical
aspects of devising multiple plans for classical planning problems. We will motivate the need
for such planners from application perspective, formally define the respective computational
problems, as well as describe the existing approaches to solving these problems. We will
finish with a hands-on session on using the existing planners.

### Target Audience

The tutorial is aimed at ICAPS audience, familiar with classical planning. We hope that the tutorial will help both the 
practitioners who want to use these tools in applications and the tools builders interested in creating efficient planners.
